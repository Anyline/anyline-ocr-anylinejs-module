## Install

`npm install @anyline/anyline-js`

## Usage

1. Copy the content of `anylinejs` to your webserver. In some cases you need to configure your webserver to serve `data` and `wasm.gz` files.

AnylineJS has to be served from a web server that supports HTTPS.

2. Import AnylineJS

```JavaScript
import { init } from '@anyline/anyline-js;
```

Alternatively you can also directly import `anyline.js` using a script tag:

```HTML
<script src="anyline.js"></script>
```

This will expose anylinejs to the window scope:

```JavaScript
const { init } = window.anylinejs;`
```

3. Initialize AnylineJS

```JavaScript
const anyline = init({
  preset: 'meter', // id, ocr, ehic, ...
  license: 'enter_your_license_key_here',
  // html container where anylineJS should be mounted to
  element: document.getElementById('root'),
  // location of the data files from step 1 (can also be an https link)
  anylinePath: '../anylinejs',
});
```

4. Start scanning

```JavaScript
anyline.startScanning().catch(console.error);
```

5. Handle the scan result

```JavaScript
anyline.onResult((data) => {
  console.log(data)
});
```

## Try it locally

`npm run demo`

Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080/demo.

or

`npm run demo:network`

In this case the HTTPS server uses a self-generated certificate so you might need to bypass the security measures of your browser. With a proper test-license issued for your internal ip-address you can test it on other devices on the network (i.E. for smartphone testing).

**The license included in the demo only allows AnylineJS to run on 127.0.0.1 and localhost**

### Typescript support

You can access the types by importing the `Types` object

```JavaScript
import { Types } from '@anyline/anyline-js;
```
